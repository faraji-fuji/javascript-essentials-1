# JavaScript Essentials 1

## lab-variables-6.js

### Estimated time
15-30 minutes

### Level of difficulty
Easy

### Objectives
Familiarize the student with:
* variables (i.e. naming, declaring, initializing and modifying their values)

### Scenario
Our task will be to create a list of contacts. Initially, the list will be
quite simple: we will only write three people to it using the data shown in
the table below. In the rest of the course, you will return to this script and
systematically extend it with new functionality, using the newly learned
elements of JavaScript.

| Name	| Phone	| Email |
|---|---|---|
| Maxwell Wright | (0191) 719 6495 | Curabitur.egestas.nunc@nonummyac.co.uk |
| Raja Villarreal |	0866 398 2895 |	posuere.vulputate@sed.com |
| Helen Richards | 0800 1111 | libero@convallis.edu |

Declare and initialize the variables where you will store all the information
(nine variables in total). Display in the console information about the first
and last contact in the form: name/phone/email.
